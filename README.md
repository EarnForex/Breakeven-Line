# Breakeven Line

Breakeven Line is a custom MT4/MT5 indicator coded by EarnForex.com. It calculates and displays the cumulative breakeven price for any number of trades opened on the same symbol.

It shows you the distance to the breakeven price, total profit/loss, total volume, and total number of trades.
